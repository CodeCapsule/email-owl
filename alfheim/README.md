# Alfheim Tales — fan-made 3D browser MMORPG

A single-player tribute to the 2013 anime-style web MMORPG *Alfheim Tales Online*, built with Three.js.
Every model, texture, icon and sound is generated in code; no assets from the original game are used.

## Play

Serve this folder with any static web server and open `index.html`:

```sh
npx http-server alfheim -p 8080   # then visit http://localhost:8080
```

Three.js loads from jsDelivr, so the first load needs an internet connection.

## What's in it

- **World of Carlyle**: Sylvan Haven town with the four Spirit shrines and fountain, Breezy Meadow, Mossveil Forest,
  the Elder Ruins with a boss arena, a river with bridges, floating islands and the World Tree on the horizon.
- **A world four times larger, up to Lv 200**: the map is 800 x 800 m with eight outer zones around the starter areas:
  Sunpetal Plains (Lv 16-30), Whispering Marsh (30-50), Ember Canyon (50-80), Frostpeak Highlands (80-110), Crystal Wilds
  (110-140), Shadow Fen (140-170), Starfall Plateau (170-200) and the Yggdrasil Gate (190-200). Each has its own biome,
  about five new monster types, elites, a field boss and an outpost camp with a merchant and a teleport point. The level
  cap is 200, and monster HP grows faster than their damage, so high-level monsters take far longer to kill.
- **4 classes, each tied to one of the four elements**: Knight (Earth), Assassin (Wind), Mage (Fire) and Priest (Water). Each class has 6 skills and a dual talent.
- **Story chapter**: 11 quests with NPC dialogs, auto-pathing from the quest tracker, kill and collect objectives and
  the Treant King Yggr boss with telegraphed red-circle attacks. Repeatable bounties follow.
- **Pets, sprites, mounts and wings**: 27 collectible pets that fight beside you (up to Lv 60), 4 elemental sprites,
  13 mounts and fairy wings. New pets and mounts drop from the new monsters and bosses or are sold by Mimi and Brom.
- **Costumes**: 23 cosmetic outfits, hats and wings in the Wardrobe (V). They change only your look, never your stats.
  Buy them at Coco's Boutique or find them in Wardrobe Boxes.
- **Dungeons**: eleven instanced dungeons with their own entrances in the world, from Mossy Hollow (Lv 6) to the
  Throne of Yggdrasil, where Fenrir, the World Devourer waits as the Lv 200 boss. Clear each chamber to break the rune
  seal ahead, then fight a boss with telegraphed attacks (slams, novas, root bursts, dragon breath, summons). Dungeons
  are hard: monsters inside are tougher than in the field, a run fails after 15 minutes or a fourth death, and bosses go
  berserk after 4 minutes. Runs are rated S/A/B; the rating sets the size of the treasure chest.
- **Relic collections and Red gear**: every dungeon hides four collection relics (crown, seal, idol and tome) dropped by
  its monsters and chest. Completing a set gives a permanent Attack and HP bonus. Four relics of one dungeon, a Crimson
  Core, Star Essence and gold forge a **Red** item at the Crimson Forge: the new top rarity, with four affixes, a
  legendary power and three gem sockets.
- **Loot**: gear drops on the ground with a light beam in its rarity color across six tiers: Common, Uncommon, Rare,
  Special, Unique and Legendary. Rare and better items roll bonus affixes (lifesteal, crit damage, cooldowns, thorns and
  more). Unique and Legendary items are named and carry a special power, such as chain lightning, meteor strikes every
  6th hit, phoenix rebirth or a healing nova. Loot auto-collects (toggle in Settings).
- **Daily and weekly missions**: a fresh set of daily missions every day and weekly missions every Monday (00:00 UTC),
  tracked automatically. Missions cover kills, dungeons, crafting, trading, donations, world bosses and guild wars. Claimed
  missions fill an activity bar with treasure chests (daily 20/40/60/80/100, weekly 150/300/450/600).
- **Guilds and guild wars**: join one of five guilds or found your own (recruits arrive while you play). Daily gold,
  material and diamond donations level the guild (up to Lv 10) for a permanent Guild Blessing (+Attack, +Max HP) and
  earn Contribution for the guild shop. Guild chat comes alive with guildmates. **Guild Wars** (Lv 10+, two a day) are
  4-minute battles in the Spirit Crystal Arena: lead four guildmates against a rival guild, destroy their crystal and
  defend yours.
- **World bosses**: every 15 minutes a world boss descends on the Storm Altar north-east of Breezy Meadow (the
  Thunderhoof Behemoth, or a festival boss such as the Pumpkin King). Other adventurers teleport in to help, a live damage
  meter ranks everyone, and rewards scale with your rank, with a bonus for the last hit.
- **Trading and crafting**: monsters drop materials and gems into a separate pouch. Gorm's Forge crafts potions, tickets,
  pet eggs, gem pouches and Rare to Unique gear (with a Masterwork chance). The Market lists goods from other players at
  prices that drift through the day; list your own items and they sell over time (cheaper sells faster, 5% tax). Players
  also whisper you trade offers.
- **Enhancement +1 to +15**: the Forge's Enhance tab levels up any piece of gear with Enhancement Stones (normal for
  +1 to +5, Greater to +10, Divine to +15) and gold. Success drops from 100% to 12% at +15; each failure adds +5% to the
  next try (up to +25%), and from +7 a failure drops the item one level unless a Protection Charm is used. Lucky Charms
  add +15%. Base stats grow 7% per level with bonus steps at +5, +10 and +15 (x2.6 at +15), affixes grow from +10, and
  enhanced weapons glow blue (+7), violet (+10) and blazing (+15). Stones drop from monsters and dungeon chests, are sold
  by Hilda and refine 5 into 1 of the next tier.
- **Gems with unique stats**: besides Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald and Topaz, eight Arcane gems carry the rare stats
  (Amethyst crit damage, Onyx lifesteal, Opal cooldowns, Aquamarine speed, Garnet thorns, Jade regeneration, Moonstone
  EXP, Citrine gold find). Every gem combines 3 into 1 up to the fifth level (Celestial). **Soulstones** socket like gems
  (one per item) and grant a named power: the twelve Unique/Legendary powers plus three found only on Soulstones (Twin
  Fang, Executioner, Giant Slayer). The Socket Drill adds up to two extra sockets (five in total) and the Soul Forge fuses
  three Brilliant gems into a random Soulstone.
- **Equipment progression**: gear can also be reforged (reroll affixes), re-tempered to your level,
  ascended up a rarity tier (Special gear awakens into a named Unique, Unique into a Legendary) and salvaged into Spirit
  Dust, Shards and Star Essence. The Legendary Codex tracks all 21 named items, grants a collection bonus and pays out at milestones.
- **Game Master Console**: the server list on the title screen has a Game Master Console link for the artifact's owner
  and editors (and in any local copy). In the published version the game reports each signed-in player's status to the
  artifact's shared database, and the console shows players online, levels, classes, zones, gear, play time, an
  activity feed (level ups, dungeon clears, deaths, rare loot), client errors and the server clock. From it the owner can
  post an announcement, start an EXP/Gold event, show a maintenance notice and send gifts to everyone or to one player.
  Players with view-only access cannot report, so share the game as Contributor to see them.
- **Seasons, festivals and leaderboards**: each month is a season with a 30-tier Season Pass (free and premium tracks)
  and a Season leaderboard that pays out when the month ends. Leaderboards also rank Battle Rating, Level, World Boss
  damage, dungeon speed, guild war wins and guilds. Festivals follow the calendar: the Harvest Moon (October to early
  November) brings Jackpuffs, the Pumpkin King, Moon Candy, pumpkin decorations in town and a festival shop with the
  Pumpkin Pip pet, orange fairy wings and a title. Winter Starlight (December) and Sakura Bloom (spring) work the same way.
- **Professions**: Mining, Herbalism and Logging at ore veins, herbs and trees in every zone (five tiers, each
  needing a higher skill level); Farming on eight plots at the homestead west of town, where seven crops grow in real
  time (water and fertilize to speed them up); Alchemy turns herbs and produce into stronger potions and timed elixirs
  (Might, Iron Skin, Swiftness, Wisdom, Fortune, Phoenix Draught); Smithing turns ore and logs into gear and Crimson
  Cores. Each profession levels to 100.
- **Shops, auction and trading**: new NPCs in town run shops: Hilda (supplies, bag scrolls), Tilly (seeds), Vera
  (alchemy), Opal (gems), Coco (costumes), Elias (relics and Crimson Cores), plus pet and stable shops and a trader at
  every outpost. Grimsby runs the **Auction House**: real-time lots with bidding, buyouts and rival bidders, and your
  own auctions. Click another adventurer and press Trade to open a trade window and haggle item for item.
- **Bag**: 48 slots, expandable to 160 with Bag Expansion Scrolls, gold or diamonds. **Sell All** sells everything up to
  a chosen rarity in one go; locked gear is always kept.
- **MMO systems**: Battle Rating, bag, skill upgrades, auto battle, auto potions, titles, daily sign-in, online gifts,
  a gold/diamond mall, world/guild/whisper chat with other adventurers, minimap and world map.
- **Icons**: every icon is a hand-made SVG in `js/icons/`, so nothing depends on the device's emoji font.
